#+TITLE: List of Windows Laptops with Precision Touchpad
#+AUTHOR: Joon Ro

It is not easy to find out if a laptop has a precision touchpad, so I wanted
to create a list of windows laptops with precision toucphad.  I merely will
add ones that I know the ones have (and have not) precision toucphad, so
contributions are welcome. (Should be very easy, you can directly edit the
list in Github). It would be great if you can provide the source of
information (URL to review page or youtube review) as well.

There is a good list at [[http://www.windowscentral.com/complete-list-laptops-precision-touchpads][Windows Central]], but it is not comprehensive, and it was not clear 
how to contribute to the list. 

Also I think it is important to have a list of laptops that do not use
precision toucphad to avoid confusion.
